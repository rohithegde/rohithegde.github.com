        Hello stranger ! <br/>
        I am Rohit - a Cloud Architect, Sr DevSecOps consultant and former App Architect with more than a decade of experience in the software field. I am also a polyglot programmer who loves making order out of chaos.
        <br/>
        I will be writing about things common in a programmer's life - from problem solving to problem discovery, from general architectural decisions to good old coding, from choosing the right tool to working with it, from learning to sharing & all that comes with it.
