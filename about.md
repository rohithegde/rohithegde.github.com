    <div class="divTableCell about-me">
        I am a polyglot programmer who has been in the open source field for more than a decade.
        <br/>
        But I hadn't embraced it's true nature - to share.  <br/>
        My research, prototypes & learnings were spread across various documents.
        <br/> <br/>
        With this blog, I aim to change that. :dart:<br/> <br/>
        I will be writing about things common in a programmer's life - from problem solving to problem discovery, from general architectural decisions to good old coding, from choosing the right tool to working with it, from learning to sharing & all that comes after it.
