    <div class="divTableCell about-me">
        I am Rohit. I am a Cloud Architect and Sr DevSecOps consultant with more than a decade of experience in the software field. I am also a polyglot programmer who loves making order out of chaos.
        <br/>

        I will be writing about things common in a programmer's life - from problem solving to problem discovery, from general architectural decisions to good old coding, from choosing the right tool to working with it, from learning to sharing & all that comes after it.
