## Background story
- I regularly meet many young developers who take on work as it comes. At times like this, I remember my uncle's words at the begining of my career "What do you want to work on ? Products or Projects ?". I didn't understand the value of this question then. But I do now.
- While a developer should be concerned primarily with problem solving, the complexity & nature of problems matters a lot. Choosing the right type of work ensures you get what you want.

## Product company
- Its great to work in a Product company in 2 cases : 
    1. A new product which solves a real world problem in a way others dont.
        - Traveling on a path less traveled, means you also encounter unique stumbling blocks on the way. Taking a crack at solving them often leads to great opportunities to learn.
        - The team usually consists of highly motivated individuals & the desire to make a difference can be very infectious !
        - It usually involves a startup like environment in which things can be quite hectic. However working in this environment for a few weeks/months prepares you for life & gives you the ability to deal with most stressful situations well. Too much of it can lead to a burnout though - so know when to say 'no' too.
    2. A well established product which is important to the owners for revenue.
        - The need to stay ahead of their competitors ensures a constant desire to innovate.
        - Being well established ensures good support from the management.
        - However if the product has a monopoly over the market, then people can become complacent.
- In both cases, there is a big need to innovate & to distinguish themselves from the competition. For the developer, this means a lot of research, learning & high motivation to make an impact.
- Daily builds & frequent deployments keep the developers on their toes.
- Working on a product forces developers to think about the big picture.
- Additionally there usually is more work satisfaction developing a product since long term goals are quite important here.
- However working in a company which just makes a clone of another product & doesn't get much traction in the market can be detrimental to one's career.
