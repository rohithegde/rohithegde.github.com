Welcome to the tech industry. Meet your companions - high attrition rates, competitive salaries, changing trends, fun, learning, problem solving, stress and offcourse layoffs.

Layoffs in the past year or so have become rampant with most big organisations joining the trend. People from diverse bands have faced the axe - from freshers to highly experienced individuals.

This blog post aims to share some lessons from the tech industry which arent readily available. My earlier post on ["5 career tips for a software engineer"]({{ site.url }}/2021/05/09/5-career-tips-for-software-engineer) focuses on what you can do to be a successful software engineer in the industry. This post focuses on activities which take place in the tech industry but on which you will not have much control. At best you can recognise the patterns and do a better job navigating them.

### You are not a significant contributor to the crown jewels of the org

- The crown jewels of an organisation are the products which deliver the most impact(usually money) or have a big potential to do so in the future.
  - Eg: For Google, the crown jewels based on revenue could be Ads, Search, Gmail, YouTube, Chrome, Maps, Android and Cloud along with some internal tools which are big enablers (eg: Borg).
- For a lot of people, the goal is to get into their "dream" company. They often forget that its a professional relationship which means that it can end when it doesnt make financial sense to continue.
- During a consolidation or recession, the ones who usually get affected are contract workers, those working on non-essential services, those working on R&D of concepts with less impact etc. Even those working on minor tweaks on a big stable product can get laid off.

### Your tech skills have become redundant

- The tech industry is one of those workstreams where you have to keep updating yourself even when it comes to core tenets. The idiom "you snooze, you lose" is very apt here.
- Chances of your tech skills being redundant are higher in some cases :
  - You are a generalist problem solver with no differentiating ability compared to others.
  - You rely on your people skills more than you rely on your tech skills. Its harder to quantify your achievements in an industry where the word "manager" is frowned upon.
  - Lesser opportunities for utilizing a niche skillset and you arent adapting to the new trends.
  - Its easy to replace you with a cheaper alternative in some other location (usually a developing country).

### Your employer believes you arent as important

- The best people I worked with are those who actively take responsibilities and become the go-to person for the tech/tool. People depend on them for solving their problems.
- If you arent known and there are upcoming options of others filling in for you or your work getting automated, then your importance greatly diminishes in the eyes of your employer.
- Those new to the job come in with a couple of big disadvantages making them ideal for layoffs during a recession :
  - In the first 6 months of their job, they are still trying to make an impact.
  - The organisation doesnt really know their worth and has survived without issues before.

## What can you do to improve your chances at surviving in the tech industry

- Join an organisation only if you get to do significant work on a core product.
- Do not switch jobs if there are chances of a looming recession. As they say - "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush". You dont want to be the new person in an organisation and the uncertainity in job security which comes with it.
- This is the Asian century. Asia looks to be more resilient to economic downturns compared to others. Quite a few folks from the US have changed bases to Asian countries for access to bigger opportunities in the developing countries and it has worked well for them. The reduced cost of living and higher potential scope of work is a big factor working in favour of Asia.
