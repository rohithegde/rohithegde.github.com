## Background

> “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life." — Confucius

This is a summary of learnings - those which I learnt while I on the job as also those which I learnt from others.
This is what I have would have told my younger self (assuming he doesn't freak out on seeing me :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: ).

## Five major tips

### 1. Plan on moving from breadth to depth of knowledge

> "If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there."  - Lewis Carroll

As a newbie, you might not have a clue on the vastness of the software field. There are so many things to explore - programming languages, databases, networking, security, cloud computing, Ops, DevOps, applications (web, desktop, mobile etc), frontend, backend, design, product specialization (eg: ERP) etc.

You should explore as much as possible in the first couple of years to get an idea of what you like or dislike. Go for a breadth of knowledge. Be a generalist of sorts. A one man army !

After a while, you should consider specializing. Why? After a few years in the field, its good to become an expert at a few things to participitate in the communities around them or guide others or just to form your own unique sphere of influence. Eg : A full stack engineer with a breadth of tech in the frontend and the backend and a depth of frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue.js).

On the other hand, you can remain a generalist but its extremely hard to be well versed with tech developments on too many fronts.

### 2. Focus on learning every year. Let it not resemble another

> "By far the best investment you can make is in yourself."  - Warren Buffett

The software field is unlike most other fields. The landscape keeps changing swiftly. Something better keeps coming along. Thats due to the power of competition as well as the efforts of the open source world.
If you want to learn one thing and keep at it for most of your career, then you will have a hard time here (exceptions will always be there...like [Cobol](https://thenewstack.io/cobol-everywhere-will-maintain/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}).

At the end of a decade, you want to have a rich experience of 10 years...not the same 1-2 years experience repeated multiple times.

This is the golden age of learning. With the Internet, you have so many avenues of learning - video, ebooks, blogs, books etc. No excuses for getting outdated.

A handy trick to ensure this - update your resume every 6 months. If there are 2 or more times when you haven't been able to add much to your resume then you know its time to switch organizations.

### 3. Every job has pros/cons. Choose wisely

[!["Dilbert Interview"](/assets/images/engineer-lessons/dilbert-interview.gif "Dilbert Interview")](https://dilbert.com/strip/2015-12-21){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}

The ideal job would have the following features :

- High salary
- Loads of learning
- Smart and friendly colleagues
- Supportive management
- Great work conditions
- Less commute (or remote work)
- Minimum politics
- Attractive work policies (eg: insurance, car lease)
- Good deal of automation !

Unfortunately there is no such thing as an ideal job. There will always be a few hits and a few misses.
You have to decide on which features combo works for you.

### 4. Every tech/job has a shelf life. Do not ignore the signs

!["Job quit"](/assets/images/engineer-lessons/job-quit.png "Job quit")

There are those of us who tend to stick around an organization for a long time. It can be 5 yrs for some...or 10 yrs for another. A solid reason for doing so would be to keep getting opportunities internallys to re-invent yourself ie to keep learning. Other reasons could be big changes in personal life (eg: marriage), high salaries, an established work life balance, the comfort factor etc.
However the likely disadvantages of sticking around for a long time are lesser learning (compared to a new job) + your salary might not be at market value anymore.

You are your greatest investment. If your learning isn't at the right level even after repeated attempts then its time to quit.

### 5. Have a routine to maintain the balance

> "A champion doesn't become a champion in the ring, he's merely recognized in the ring. His “becoming” happens during his daily routine" - Joe Louis

We usually divide our time amongst the buckets of :

- Work
- Family and friends
- Health
- Sleep
- Hobbies

If you don't set limits, then your work will likely take a good chunk of time from the other buckets.
**Having a daily routine is the single most important activity you can do to ensure all round happiness**.
Maintaining a journal is a good way to reinforce this habit.

## Five minor tips

**6. Take pride in your contribution to work while remaining humble enough to acknowledge others**

> “Try and leave this world a little better than you found it.” - Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell

Similarly, [Uncle Bob says](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/ch08.html){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} "Always check a module in cleaner than when you checked it out".
Every work you do is a signoff from you. It represents you. As such, you would want it to be in a good state after you are done with it.

Being proud of your work ensures a high quality. But do ensure that it doesn't have an impact on your ego. If someone points out some issues in it, then you should be humble enough to learn from it and improve further.

**7. Keep it simple**

The complexity of the software field with the various options out there can make things difficult.

We should take care that we try to keep it simple - whether its architecture or implementation or even explanations.
If we cannot explain the concepts of the work done in a simple way then its likely that we haven't implemented it in a simple way.

**8. Be part of a community for knowledge sharing**

The fastest way to learn a lot of things in a short time would be to participate in a community - meeting or online (eg: reddit group).

**9. Have a side project of your own.**

Having a side project of your own gives you the opportunity to try out things without being bounded by work rules and to unleash your creativity and ideas on a blank slate.

**10. Automation is the key !**

Taking efforts to automate things ensures that your efforts are not wasted in mundane repitative tasks.
Automating things also can be a great activity to learn and give knowledge sessions on.

Eg : Having an automatic dev workstation setup on your Mac like [Formation](https://github.com/minamarkham/formation){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}.

Thats the summary of my learnings I felt would be useful to someone starting out in the software field.
