Do certifications matter ? Should I be happy with that one cert ? Does it make sense to go for ALL the AWS certs ? <br/>
I started my certification journey couple of years ago - quite late in my career. I also followed the top certified folks on LinkedIn for a while to see if I could learn from their stengths as also mistakes.<br/>
Based on my experience, I am attempting to create a sensible certification plan which works.<br/>

Note : These certs look great on the resume...but it can take multiple years for a working individual to get all of them...

## When certifications can help

### Marketing yourself

- Certifications help in marketing yourself as they help you stand out.
- Additionally they are also mentioned in job profiles posted by top companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft etc.

### Getting a structured introduction to a new workstream

- If you are getting into a new workstream or domain, then certifications can be a well structured way to learn the concepts while serving as a foundation for your upcoming work.
- Eg: Before building a Azure related product few years ago, I studied for an Azure certification.

### Using your experience to get a win with least effort

- If you have good experience on a workstream (eg: Data Engineering in Azure), then a certification in it will be easier to get while gaining a new entry on your resume.
- Eg: I now have some experience working on the data related tools in Azure (eg: Data Factory) which is why I plan to give the Azure Data Engineer exam soon.

### Getting hands on in some cases

Some certifications like those for Kubernetes are very practical in nature and require you to solve problems using k8s cli commands. Studying for it automatically gives you handson experience.

## When certifications can be a problem

### Giving you a false sense of confidence

- Half knowledge is dangerous. Certified folks with not much handson experence are like those new to the job - full of confidence of what they know but no idea of what they dont know.
- **Certifications cannot replace practical experience.** The confidence and attention to detail that comes from practical experience can never come from clearing an exam.

### Not making the best use of your time
  
- We all have limited time. Focusing on certifications whose knowledge isnt used directly anytime soon isnt a great use of time.
- Additionally clearing certifications require a fair bit of maintenance time too as most of them need to be renewed in 1/2/3 years.
- Aiming for all the certifications of a specific cloud may seem like a great advertisement for your profile but its very redundant and seems like an attempt to get validated by others.
  - Eg: Having an Azure Fundamentals cert while also having the top Azure Solutions Architect cert.
- Maintaining a lot of certifications leads to sacrificing time from somewhere else - health, work, family or other avenues of tech community contribution(Open source contributions, technical blogs, knowledge sessions, StackOverflow posts etc).

### Jack of all trades

- It makes sense for someone new to the industry to try out a lot of technologies and gain many certs. But it need not reflect well on an experienced person to maintain a huge variety of certs. It can reflect that the profile is that of a generalist and not of a specialist. While the generalist profile of "problem solver" sounds good, many experienced job profiles out there require specialisation.

## Developing a balanced plan

### Let your career direct your certification plan

- Do NOT go for each and every certificate out there. Spend some time to atleast plan the next one year of your career.
- Start off small. Focus on a single cert then take it from there.
- Instead of breadth, aim for a depth of certifications. Assuming you have some practical cloud exp, 2-6 cloud certs are more than enough for mastering a cloud as long as they are specialised certs and not the generic ones.
- For going deep into one cloud, go directly for the associate level cert. If you are new to the cloud and dont plan on going deep anytime soon then go for the fundamental cert.
- Eg: For Azure, the Azure Solutions Architect cert showcases your all round Azure cloud knowledge while the specialised Azure certs like Azure Data Engineer, Azure IAM Engineer, Azure Security Engineer etc showcase specific skillsets in the cloud.

### Have SMART goals

- SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely.
- Once you have zeroed in on the certs matching your goals, commit to each cert via checklists with end-dates.
- Eg : For an infra engineer experienced in k8s looking to begin his/her k8s certification journey on Jan 1 2023, the checklist could look like this :
  - CKAD
    - Udemy course(15 hrs) : Jan 15 (Assume it will take 30 hrs for going through the course + some prctice : 5 hrs per weekend day + 1 hr per weekday).
    - Official Practice test 1 (2 hrs) : Jan 22 (Assume it will take you an extra week for revision).
    - Official Practice test 2 (2 hrs) : Jan 23.
    - Certification exam (2 hrs) : Jan 28.
  - CKA and CKS - Similar timelines with a break of 1-2 weeks between each goal.

### Radiate your strengths well

- Your digital profile should highlight your strengths. A healthy mix of practical experience, contributing to the tech community and certifications are the best way forward.
- Relying purely on certifications to market yourself can make you a one trick pony and potentially highlight lack of depth in the other areas.
- If you arent benefiting from an existing cert then do NOT renew it. Especially if it takes significant time and effort.
- Dont forget to spend time on other endaevours too. Get cracking on that new tool you wanted to build. Enough of only being a consumer of StackOverflow...time to spend some time helping others on it. Time to mint a few blog posts with that deep expertise of yours :thumbsup:.
