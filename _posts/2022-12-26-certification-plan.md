Do certifications matter ? Should I be happy with that one cert ? Does it make sense to go for ALL the AWS/Azure/GCP certs ? Which certs should I go for ?
There are plenty of factors which can play a role in answering these questions. This blog post lists them out to help create a certification plan which works for you.

## When certifications can help

### Marketing yourself

- Certifications help in marketing yourself as they are a visual beacon for recruiters.
- Additionally they are also mentioned in the job profiles posted by top companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft etc.

### Getting a structured introduction

- If you are getting into a new workstream or domain, then certifications can be a well structured way to learn the concepts while serving as a foundation for your upcoming work.
- Eg: Before building a Azure related product few years ago, I studied for an Azure certification.

### Using your experience

- If you have good experience on a workstream or domain (eg: Data Engineering in Azure), then a certification in it will be easier to get while marketing your knowledge on your digital profile.
- Eg: I now have some experience working on the data related tools in Azure (eg: Data Factory) which is why I plan to give the Azure Data Engineer exam soon.

### Getting hands on in some cases

Some certifications like those for Kubernetes are very practical in nature and require you to solve problems using k8s cli commands. Studying for it automatically gives you handson experience.

## When certifications can be a problem

### Giving you a false sense of confidence

- Half knowledge is dangerous. Certified folks with not much handson experence are like those new to the job - full of confidence of what they know but no idea of what they dont know.
- **Certifications cannot replace practical experience.** The confidence and attention to detail that comes from practical experience can never come from clearing an exam.

### Not making the best use of your time
  
- We all have limited time. Focusing on certifications whose knowledge isnt used directly anytime soon isnt a great use of time.
- Additionally clearing certifications require a fair bit of maintenance time too as most of them need to be renewed in 1/2/3 years.
- If you are maintaining a wall of a lot of certifications then you are sacrificing time from somewhere else - work, family or other avenues of tech community contribution(Open source contributions, technical blogs, knowledge sessions, StackOverflow posts etc).

### Duplication of efforts

- Aiming for all the certifications of a specific cloud may seem like a great advertisement for your profile but its very redundant and seems like an attempt to get validated by others.
- Eg: Having an Azure Fundamentals cert while also having the top Azure Solutions Architect cert.

## Developing a balanced plan

### Radiating your strengths well

- Your digital profile should radiate your strengths. A healthy mix of practical experience, contributing to the tech community and certifications are the best way forward.
- Relying purely on certifications to market yourself will make you a one trick pony and potentially highlight lack of expertise in the other areas.

### Let your career direct your certification plan

- Let your certification plan reflect your career direction. Do NOT go for each and every certificate out there. Spend some time to plan the next one year of your career.
- Eg: I worked on other clouds but spent the last few years digging deep into Azure. After getting my list of Azure certs, I want to now branch out to get certs from other major clouds so that it highlights my multi-cloud expertise.

### Go for depth

- Instead of breadth, aim for a depth of certifications. 1-6 cloud certs are more than enough for mastering a cloud (assuming you have practical exp too!) as long as they are specialised certs and not the generic ones.
- Eg: For Azure, the Azure Solutions Architect cert showcases your all round Azure cloud knowledge while the specialised Azure certs like Azure Data Engineer, Azure IAM Engineer, Azure Security Engineer etc showcase specific skillsets in the cloud.

### Know when to say no

- If you arent benefiting from an existing cert then do not renew it. Especially if it takes significant time and effort.
- Move on to other endaevours. Get cracking on that new tool you wanted to build. Enough of only being a consumer of StackOverflow...time to spend some time helping others on it. Time to mint a few blog posts with that deep expertise of yours :thumbsup:.
