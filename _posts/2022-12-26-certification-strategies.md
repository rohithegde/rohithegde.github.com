Do certifications matter ? Should I be happy with that one cert ? Should I aim for ALL the certs of AWS ?
There are plenty of factors which play a role in this decision. Looking to shed light on some of them so as to help you decide on your certification plan.

## When certifications can help

- Certifications help in marketing yourself as they are a visual beacon for recruiters.
- If you are getting into a new workstream or domain, then certifications can be a well structured way to learn the concepts while serving as a foundation for your upcoming work.
  - Eg: I studied for an Azure certification before starting off on an Azure related project many years ago.
- If you have good experience on a workstream or domain (eg: Data Engineering in Azure), then a certification in it will be easier to get while marketing your knowledge on your digital profile.
  - Eg: I now have some experience working on the data related tools in Azure (eg: Data Factory) which is why I plan to give the Azure Data Engineer exam soon.
- Some certifications like those for Kubernetes are very practical in nature and require you to solve problems using k8s cli commands. Studying for it automatically gives you handson experience.

## When certifications can be a problem

- Half knowledge is dangerous. Certified folks with not much handson experence are like those new to the job - full of confidence of what they know but no idea of what they dont know. **Certifications cannot replace practical experience.** The confidence and attention to detail that comes from practical experience can never come from studying for an exam.
- We all have limited time. Focusing on certifications whose knowledge isnt used directly anytime soon isnt a great use of time. Additionally clearing certifications require a fair bit of maintenance time too as most of them need to be renewed in 1/2/3 years.
- Aiming for all the certifications of a specific cloud may seem like a great advertisement for your profile but its very redundant and seems like an attempt to get validated by others.
  - Eg: Having an Azure Fundamentals cert while also having the top Azure Solutions Architect cert.

## A balanced plan

- Your digital career profile should radiate your real world image. A healthy mix of practical experience, community sharing (Open source contributions, technical blogs, knowledge sessions, StackOverflow posts etc) and certifications are the best way forward.
- Instead of breadth, aim for a depth of certifications. 1-6 cloud certs are more than enough for mastering a cloud (assuming you have practical exp too!).
  - Eg: For Azure, the Azure Solutions Architect cert showcases your generic Azure cloud knowledge while the specialised Azure certs like Azure Data Engineer, Azure IAM Engineer, Azure Security Engineer etc showcase your depth in the cloud.
- Let your certification plan reflect your career direction.
  - Eg: An expert on Azure who wants to highlight multi-cloud expertise would have certs starting with Azure and then move onto the other major clouds.
- If you arent benefiting from an existing cert then do not renew it if it takes significant time and effort.
