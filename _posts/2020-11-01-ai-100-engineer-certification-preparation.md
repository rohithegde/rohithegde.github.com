## Background

> “Knowledge is power. Knowledge shared is power multiplied.” - Robert Boyce

AI-100 is the Azure AI Engineer exam. I cleared the exam today ie Nov 1, 2020.
This is my 3rd Azure certification. You can read about the others [here]({{ site.url }}/#certification).

I recently worked on Azure bot services for a project. It got me interested in Azure's cognitive services.
After my employer organized a related training session on AI-100, I got the drive to go for this certifrication.

## Preparation

[Skills measured](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ai-100){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} :

- Analyze solution requirements (25-30%)
- Design AI solutions (40-45%)
- Implement and monitor AI solutions (25-30%)

As you see - this needs a lot of foundation knowledge (Azure + data engineering). I found 50% of the exam questions to involve the fundamentals of Azure. The rest was a mix of cogntitive services and other supporting tools.
The exam is targeted for a data engineer who is comfortable with Azure. Since I cleared AZ-300 and AZ-301 recently, I too found the exam to be easy :smiley: .
But it still involved going through a lot of course material !

There aren't many AI-100 courses out there. But couple of  websites which helped me prepare :

### Cloud Academy

- I recommend the [AI-100 learning path](https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/ai-100-exam-preparation-designing-and-implementing-an-azure-ai-solution-1-1334/){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}.
- Its well focused and short (5 hrs or so).
- The course focuses on Azure's cognitive services and some of the supporting tools.
- Its expected for the audience to know the basics of Azure.

### Udemy practice tests

- [This offering](https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-100-designing-and-implement-azure-ai-solution-exam-prep-certacademy/learn/quiz/4953126){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} helped me a lot.
- The 5 practice tests are really good and test your knowledge well. They also point out chinks in your Azure knowhow quite a bit.
- The duration of each test was around 1 hour each though I completed each test within 30 min.

## Scheduling the exam

You can schedule the exam through the [Microsoft Certification Dashboard page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/dashboard.aspx){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}.

## Pre-exam process [Warning:Stress ahead!]

Like AZ-301, this was a bit of a stressful experience for me.
I did the pre-exam prep below around 20 min before the exam :

- I had to download a software which tested my machine for compatibility.
- Send pics from 4 directions of my surroundings (closed room).
- After a live 360 degrees scan from the Proctor, The exam was supposed to begin.
- The pre exam profile questionaire wrapped up quickly.
- **However here it got a bit stressful** :weary:
  - The software stopped working after it couldn't stop some background app. It had me waiting for some response...but to no avail.
  - The supervisor mentioned some tech issue on the Mac version of the software and gave me a voucher to give the exam some other time in the future.
  - Scheduling the exam a 2nd time after 5 days didnt help. This time the app got stuck at 'Loading'...and no amount of hitting the 'retry' button helped. Got another voucher again and rescheduled the exam after 3 days again.

## The AI-100 exam

- **It was an exam of 3 hours with 30 questions and passing score of 70%**.
- Since I had completed the practice tests well in advance, I knew that time wasnt an issue for me.
- The practice test experience helped. Found a lot of similar questions from the tests.
- I submitted the exam in 30 min. Completed the questions in 25 min. Spent 5 min reviewing the questions about whom I wasn't sure about.
- I had to fill a survey on myself and nature of the exam after this (no impact on the exam results).
- I immediately received the congratulatory message page for clearing the exam.

The exam report with certification id arrived in 10 minutes.

## Final thoughts

- I loved studying for A1-100. It really improves your basics on data engineering and reference architectures.
- I think I might go for the data engineer path of certifications as my current work is pushing me towards it + I found it quite interesting when studying for AI-100.
- Besides the main cognitive services, I focused on smaller topics which helped :
  - [Azure reference architectures for AI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/big-data/ai-overview){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} (especially IoT and real time analytics use cases).
  - Azure on the Edge.
  - Machine learning concepts and tooling.
  - Azure Stream analytics.
  - HDInsight (Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Hive, Kafka etc).
  - Data Factory and Data Bricks.
- Practice tests help a lot to identify chinks in your armour. Give as many as possible and multiple times if needed.

I wish you the best of luck if you plan on giving this exam :thumbsup:.
<br/>Feel free to share your experiences. Every bit of knowledge helps :blush:.
