## Background

> “They give me questions I dont know. I give them answers they dont know” - Anonymous

The [HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate exam](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate){:target="\_blank" rel="nofollow"} is ideal for Infrastructure and Ops engineers. I cleared the exam today ie June 8, 2023. I had previous given the 002 version of this exam around 2 yrs ago. You can read about my journey on other certifications [here]({{ site.url }}/#certification){:target="\_blank"}.

My experience as a Cloud Architect and hands-on cloud engineer gave me the confidence to go for this certification.

## Preparation

### Official study material

- HashiCorp recommends those with Terraform experience to study with the [review guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003/associate-review-003){:target="\_blank" rel="nofollow"} while those new to Terraform are better off with the [study guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003/associate-study-003){:target="\_blank" rel="nofollow"}. Same content in both but the study guide has a better structure for learning from scratch.
- Those with Terraform experience should be able to breeze through the material in a weekend while those new will probably take a week or so.

### Udemy Practice tests by Bryan Krausen

- I relied on a [set of 5 practice tests](https://mckinsey.udemy.com/course/terraform-associate-practice-exam/){:target="\_blank" rel="nofollow"}.
- Similar to the actual certification exam, each test was hour long with 57 questions.
- I would give each exam + review the answers at the end to improve my score the next time. I was able to complete each test in half the time (30 min) every time.
- My scores were
  1. 82%
  2. 84%
  3. 87%
  4. 84%
  5. 89%
- I was confident of doing well in the exams now.

## Scheduling the exam

I scheduled the exam through the [HashiCorp website](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate){:target="\_blank" rel="nofollow"} which eventually took me to PSI page.

## Pre-exam process

I did the pre-exam prep below around 30 min before the exam :

- I had to download a software which tested my machine for compatibility.
- Take a pic of my identity card.
- Take 15 sec videos of my surroundings.
- Take 15 sec video of my hands and ears.
- After another live 360 degrees scan from the Proctor, The exam was ready to begin.

## Exam

- **It was an exam of 1 hour with 57 questions and I needed 70% to pass**.
- Similar to the practice tests, I started off on a quick note. I completed 20 questions every 10 min.
- It took me 30 minutes to complete 57 questions.
- I had flagged around 9 questions whose answer I wasnt sure of. Some of them had tricky language.
- I had to fill a survey on myself and nature of the exam after this (no impact on the exam results).
- I immediately received the congratulatory message page for clearing the exam along with the details of my performance. **I got 86%**.

The certificate was added to [Credly](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned){:target="\_blank" rel="nofollow"} in 48 hours.

## Final thoughts

This was the easiest online exam I have given. Focusing on the cli commands is the main ask. Highly recommended for all engineers who work with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) as its a quick win.

I wish you the best of luck if you plan on giving this exam :thumbsup:.
