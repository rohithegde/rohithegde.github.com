I had done this research quite a long time back. Adding to the blog now.

## Objective
This document provides information on installing Zsh (pronounced as Zash or Zee-shell) on an Ubuntu machine & checking out some cool features.

## Background Info

- The Z shell (zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a powerful command interpreter for shell scripting. 
- Zsh can be thought of as an extended Bourne shell with a large number of improvements, including some features of bash, ksh, and tcsh.

## Prerequisites
- You should have Ubuntu machine 1.5Ghz processor.
- You should have minimum knowledge of Unix commands like ps, cd, cp, chmod, etc.
- You should know what is Zsh.

## Setup Zsh

```shell
/* Install zsh */
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install zsh

/* Set zsh as default shell */
sudo chsh -s $(which zsh) $(whoami)

/* Customize */
vim ~/.zshrc
```

## Setup Framework
- No matter which framework you chose, add your aliases file if you want to link it from your earlier bash profile:
    - source ~/.bash_aliases
- Then save the .zshrc file & reload the terminal.

### [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} Vs [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}
- oh-my-zsh is the original community driven configuration management framework while prezto has been forked from it.
- prezto is faster
- oh-my-zsh has a larger number of themes & plugins

### Setup Prezto
- Installation :

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"

setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
for rcfile in "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/runcoms/^README.md(.N); do
  ln -s "$rcfile" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.${rcfile:t}"
done
```

- Select theme & plugins in the ~/.zpreztorc file
- Type prompt -l to show available themes.
- My personal favourite theme is paradox though it is a bit complex to setup.
- Alternatively you can create or customize existing themes in the folder /usr/share/zsh/functions/Prompts/ OR ~/.zprezto/modules/prompt/functions/ folder

### Setup oh-my-zsh
- Installation
```bash
sudo wget --no-check-certificate http://install.ohmyz.sh -O - | sh
```
- Select one of the themes in http://zshthem.es/all/ based on what info you need. by setting the ZSH_THEME. 
- My personal fav themes from the basic ones are “xiong-chiamiov-plus”, “smt” & “gnzh”. 
- Alternatively you can use “random” to cycle between various themes :
    - ZSH_THEME="gnzh"
- Activate Plugins by setting specific plugins of oh-my-zsh
    - plugins=(git command-not-found)

An example of how well you can customize your Zsh terminal :
